The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles the development of Media Trakker, successfully navigating feature implementation and significant architectural pivots based on user feedback. Initially, the focus was on delivering a core MVP for movies and TV shows with TMDB integration and MongoDB caching, achieving a quick aha moment.. Subsequent phases involved expanding media types (Anime, Manga, Books) with AniList and Google Books APIs, addressing integration-specific issues. A major turning point was a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul, transitioning from tabs to a sidebar navigation, introducing dedicated media pages, a dashboard, and a profile section, all enhanced with Apple-like design principles and a dark mode. Crucially, the user's foresight on MongoDB scalability led to a complete architectural shift to PostgreSQL, which, despite an initial misinterpretation leading to a hybrid approach, was fully rectified to a pure PostgreSQL solution for all data, exemplifying adaptability and error correction. This trajectory demonstrates incremental development, rapid iteration, and strong user-driven refinement.
